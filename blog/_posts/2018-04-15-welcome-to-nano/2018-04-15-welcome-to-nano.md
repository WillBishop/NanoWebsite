Wow, what a *loooonnnnggg* time coming. 

I've been working on Nano since before I even had an Apple Watch. Well... that's not *that* long, I got my Apple Watch on December 25th, [the same day I teased Nano for the first time.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AppleWatch/comments/7m0zbt/got_an_s3_for_christmas_i_already_know_strapping/). 

Nano has not been an easy journey and it hasn't come without its dissapointing times. But throughtout the development of Nano, I've learnt so much and met so many amazing people, and I'd like to talk about some of that today.
