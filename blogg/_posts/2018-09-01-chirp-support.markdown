**Chirp does not collect any information about you**, it’s really that simple. 

If anything, you should care more about [Twitter’s Privacy Policy](https://twitter.com/privacy), because that’s probaby more relevant.

Not only do I not care about how you use Chirp (aside from if you want a new feature or find a bug), but I simply wouldn’t have the resources to store your data even if I wanted to.

The End.
